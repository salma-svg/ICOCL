# Iron Casting Optimization with Constraint Learning

## Overview

This repository contains the source code for my **Iron Casting Optimization with Constraint Learning** project. The project focuses on applying optimization techniques combined with constraint learning to improve iron casting processes.

You can view the project details on my portfolio website [here](https://salma-svg.github.io/projects/OCL/).

The website showcases the project's methodology, code, and outcomes. Itâ€™s designed to provide potential employers or collaborators with a comprehensive understanding of my work in optimization and operations research.

Thank you for visiting, and I look forward to future collaborations!

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for implementing the optimization models.
- **Optimization Techniques**: Various optimization strategies for linear programming.
- **Operations Research**: Application of operations research methods to solve complex industrial problems.
